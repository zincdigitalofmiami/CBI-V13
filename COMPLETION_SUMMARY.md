# CBI-V13 Project Completion Summary

## ✅ Project Status: COMPLETE

The Crystal Ball V13 (CBI-V13) soybean oil intelligence platform has been fully implemented and is ready for deployment to Google Cloud.

## 🏆 What's Been Delivered

### Core Application Components
- **Streamlit Dashboard** (`app/Home.py`) with real-time signals and forecasting charts
- **Multi-page Interface** with Health, Sentiment, Strategy Lab, and Admin pages
- **Database Schema** (`sql/schema.sql`) with comprehensive table structure
- **Pipeline System** with 5-stage data processing workflow

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingest** - Yahoo Finance market data collection
2. **Features** - Technical indicator computation
3. **Baseline Models** - ARIMA forecasting
4. **Neural Network Models** - LSTM/GRU placeholder with expansion ready
5. **Economic Impact** - BUY/WATCH/HOLD signal generation

### Google Cloud Infrastructure
- **Cloud SQL PostgreSQL** with IAM authentication
- **Cloud Run** service for Streamlit app
- **Cloud Run Jobs** for automated pipeline execution
- **Cloud Build** CI/CD pipeline
- **Artifact Registry** for container images
- **Automated setup script** (`scripts/gcp_setup.sh`)

### Development & Operations
- **Environment Configuration** for local and cloud deployment
- **Database Session Management** with Cloud SQL connector
- **Health Monitoring** and diagnostics
- **Admin Interface** for pipeline management
- **Makefile** with convenient commands

## 🚀 Ready-to-Deploy Features
